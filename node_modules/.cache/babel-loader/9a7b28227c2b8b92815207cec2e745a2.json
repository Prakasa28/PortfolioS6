Additionally, we explored the dynamic nature of sound levels throughout their daily schedules. Our comprehensive approach involved studying relevant literature, analyzing documents, researching competitors, and engaging in insightful user interviews. As a result, we acquired valuable insights into the needs and challenges faced by PE teachers. <br/><br/> Now equipped with this knowledge, we are ready to progress to the next step—the Define phase. Building upon the findings and results obtained during the Discover phase, our focus shifts towards obtaining a deeper understanding of the problem at hand. By utilizing the gathered information, we aim to clarify and define the specific design challenges that must be addressed. This holistic comprehension will be instrumental in the development of effective and impactful design solutions.\",\r\n  },\r\n  // Add more question objects as needed\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default groupProjectData;\r\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,OAAOA,eAAP,MAA4B,sCAA5B,C,CACA;AACA;;AACA,OAAOC,aAAP,MAA0B,oCAA1B;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,6BAAnB;AACA,OAAOC,SAAP,MAAsB,gCAAtB;AACA,OAAOC,SAAP,MAAsB,gCAAtB;AACA,OAAOC,SAAP,MAAsB,gCAAtB;AACA,OAAOC,kBAAP,MAA+B,yCAA/B;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,0BAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,0BAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,0BAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,0BAAhB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,0BAAhB;AAEA,MAAMC,gBAAgB,GAAG;EACvBC,MAAM,EAAE;IACNC,OAAO,EAAE,eADH;IAENC,UAAU,EAAE;EAFN,CADe;EAKvBC,MAAM,EAAE;IACNF,OAAO,EAAE,2CADH;IAENC,UAAU,EAAE;EAFN,CALe;EAUvBE,iBAAiB,EAAE,gBAVI;EAYvBC,UAAU,EAAE;IACVC,QAAQ,EAAE,yCADA;IAEVJ,UAAU,EAAE,UAFF;IAGVK,OAAO,EAAE,mBAHC;IAIVC,IAAI,EAAE,EAJI;IAKVC,aAAa,EAAE,MALL;IAMVC,GAAG,EAAE,+RANK;IAOVC,aAAa,EAAE,MAPL;IAQVC,GAAG,EAAE,0XARK;IASVC,aAAa,EAAE,UATL;IAUVC,OAAO,EACL,sSAXQ;IAYVC,iBAAiB,EAAE,4BAZT;IAaVC,UAAU,EACR,gQAdQ;IAeVC,KAAK,EAAE9B;EAfG,CAZW;EA8BvB+B,WAAW,EAAE;IACXZ,QAAQ,EAAE,iEADC;IAEXJ,UAAU,EAAE,UAFD;IAGXK,OAAO,EAAE,sBAHE;IAIXC,IAAI,EAAE,EAJK;IAKXC,aAAa,EAAE,MALJ;IAMXC,GAAG,EAAE,yNANM;IAOXC,aAAa,EAAE,MAPJ;IAQXC,GAAG,EAAE,0WARM;IASXC,aAAa,EAAE,UATJ;IAUXC,OAAO,EACL,8WAXS;IAaXC,iBAAiB,EAAE,4BAbR;IAcXC,UAAU,EACR,qRAfS;IAgBXC,KAAK,EAAEzB;EAhBI,CA9BU;EAiDvB2B,aAAa,EAAE;IACbb,QAAQ,EACN,2EAFW;IAGbJ,UAAU,EAAE,UAHC;IAIbK,OAAO,EAAE,iBAJI;IAKbC,IAAI,EAAE,EALO;IAMbC,aAAa,EAAE,MANF;IAObC,GAAG,EAAE,4OAPQ;IAQbC,aAAa,EAAE,MARF;IASbC,GAAG,EAAE,yeATQ;IAUbC,aAAa,EAAE,UAVF;IAWbC,OAAO,EACL,0lBAZW;IAabC,iBAAiB,EAAE,4BAbN;IAcbC,UAAU,EACR,qOAfW;IAiBbC,KAAK,EAAExB;EAjBM,CAjDQ;EAqEvB2B,kBAAkB,EAAE,cArEG;EAsEvBC,WAAW,EAAE;IACXb,IAAI,EAAE,wiBADK;IAEXF,QAAQ,EACN,wEAHS;IAIXJ,UAAU,EAAE,UAJD;IAKXK,OAAO,EAAE,cALE;IAMXE,aAAa,EAAE,MANJ;IAOXC,GAAG,EAAE,8OAPM;IAQXC,aAAa,EAAE,MARJ;IASXC,GAAG,EAAE,qeATM;IAUXC,aAAa,EAAE,UAVJ;IAWXC,OAAO,EACL,4bAZS;IAaXC,iBAAiB,EAAE,4BAbR;IAcXC,UAAU,EAAE,EAdD;IAgBXM,MAAM,EAAE5B,GAhBG;IAiBX6B,MAAM,EAAE5B,GAjBG;IAkBX6B,MAAM,EAAE5B,GAlBG;IAmBX6B,MAAM,EAAE5B,GAnBG;IAoBX6B,MAAM,EAAE5B;EApBG,CAtEU;EA6FvB6B,iBAAiB,EAAE,cA7FI;EA8FvBC,cAAc,EACZ,kjBA/FqB;EAiGvBC,gBAAgB,EAAE;IAChBvB,QAAQ,EAAE,sBADM;IAEhBJ,UAAU,EAAE,UAFI;IAGhBK,OAAO,EAAE,QAHO;IAIhBC,IAAI,EAAE,EAJU;IAKhBC,aAAa,EAAE,MALC;IAMhBC,GAAG,EAAE,6iBANW;IAOhBC,aAAa,EAAE,MAPC;IAQhBC,GAAG,EAAE,8jBARW;IAShBC,aAAa,EAAE,UATC;IAUhBC,OAAO,EACL,8gBAXc;IAYhBC,iBAAiB,EAAE,4BAZH;IAahBC,UAAU,EAAE,EAbI;IAchBC,KAAK,EAAE5B;EAdS,CAjGK;EAkHvByC,UAAU,EAAE;IACVxB,QAAQ,EAAE,oDADA;IAEVJ,UAAU,EAAE,UAFF;IAGVK,OAAO,EAAE,uBAHC;IAIVC,IAAI,EAAE,EAJI;IAKVC,aAAa,EAAE,MALL;IAMVC,GAAG,EAAE,sYANK;IAOVC,aAAa,EAAE,MAPL;IAQVC,GAAG,EAAE,gkBARK;IASVC,aAAa,EAAE,UATL;IAUVC,OAAO,EACL,+GAXQ;IAYVC,iBAAiB,EAAE,4BAZT;IAaVC,UAAU,EAAE,EAbF;IAcVC,KAAK,EAAE3B;EAdG,CAlHW;EAmIvByC,kBAAkB,EAAE,iBAnIG;EAoIvBC,eAAe,EACb,weArIqB;EAuIvBC,WAAW,EAAE;IACX3B,QAAQ,EAAE,iEADC;IAEXJ,UAAU,EAAE,UAFD;IAGXK,OAAO,EAAE,cAHE;IAIXC,IAAI,EAAE,EAJK;IAKXC,aAAa,EAAE,MALJ;IAMXC,GAAG,EAAE,sNANM;IAOXG,aAAa,EAAE,UAPJ;IAQXC,OAAO,EACL,mRATS;IAUXG,KAAK,EAAE1B;EAVI,CAvIU;EAoJvB2C,MAAM,EAAE;IACNC,aAAa,EACX,yiBAFI;IAGNlC,OAAO,EAAE,aAHH,CAIN;IACA;;EALM,CApJe,CA2JvB;;AA3JuB,CAAzB;AA8JA,eAAeF,gBAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
