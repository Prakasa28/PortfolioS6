      "In the second phase of my project, based on the insights gathered from the initial phase, which included literature studies, trend analysis, and expert interviews, I began sketching my portfolio website in a paper visualizing how I wanted the website to look, Once I translated my ideas into a paper sketch and had a clear structure in mind, I proceeded to create a low-fidelity wireframe, establishing the structure of the portfolio. From there with the low-fidelity wireframe as a foundation, I then moved on to developing a high-fidelity prototype using Figma This allowed me to add more detail, refine the visual elements, and bring my website concept to life in a more realistic manner. The hi-fi prototype served as a more polished and interactive version of the website.",

    "I worked on the project to create a digital portfolio. This portfolio includes all the projects I did during my sixth semester of ICT and Media Design. It's an important tool for me when I want to find an internship. The goal of this portfolio is to showcase the projects I worked on, both individually and with a group, during my studies in the sixth semester.</br></br>The project lasted for four weeks. In the beginning, I spent a whole week making a plan and figuring out what I wanted to research. I had some trouble understanding if I needed to make a portfolio to show my work from this semester or to use it to find an internship. Eventually, I understood that it should focus on my semester's work.</br></br>One good thing about the project was that there were a lot of resources available on the internet. They helped me find ideas and inspiration. The downside was that it was difficult to know what would work and what employers expected, eventually I figured it by talking to experts. </br></br>I managed to finish the first version of the portfolio by the end of the four weeks, which was good. But I should have updated it regularly throughout the semester and gotten feedback to make it better. </br></br>The main challenge was doing the research, design, and development of the portfolio in just four weeks. It was a learning experience for me. </br></br>By working on this project, I learned how to set realistic goals. At first, I was too ambitious and didn't consider the time I had. But I learned what I could accomplish in four weeks. </br></br>For the future, I want to improve my programming and design skills. I'm already taking steps to learn more about programming by attending meetups and learning from experts.",
