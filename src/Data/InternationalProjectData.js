    "Welcome to this page where I will showcase the work I did for the international project. Most of the tasks I worked on were done in a group. The main goal of the project was to come up with a concept for an 'Empathic Building' to make the Fontys TQ building more empathetic. Here, you will see how we approached the problem and what our final concept was. <br/> <br/> I worked in a team with students from different countries in Europe. This mix of cultures brought together different perspectives, experiences, and skills. Each team member contributed their own ideas, languages, and ways of working, which created an exciting and inclusive environment. This diversity helped us be more creative, understand each other globally, and come up with a wide range of ideas and solutions. Our team's varied backgrounds made collaboration, learning, and personal growth really strong.",

We also took input from stakeholders to develop a persona, which represents a typical user. We then created a problem statement to clearly define the issue we want to solve. To gain different perspectives on the problem, we analysed the problem statement and created a POV table. Finally, we used all the insights we gathered to finalize the concept.",

This makes it hard for the students to find their way around, learn effectively, and use the space well. To fix this, the class definitions could be improved, the environment could be more welcoming, and by enhancing the building's layout and structure.",

  reflection:
    "During the project, our main aim was to create an Empathic Building concept. It was an amazing experience working together with people from different cultures. I had the chance to teach them new things and, at the same time, learn from their expertise. <br/><br/>The project didn't last long; it only took one week, which means we had five days to work on it. This short timeframe made it challenging to come up with a concept for the given problem. At first, the project's scope was a bit confusing, but after talking with the stakeholders, it became much clearer. <br/><br/>One remarkable thing about the project was the great freedom we had. We were told to use our imagination and not worry if the required technology didn't exist. The stakeholders just wanted us to come up with the best concept we could think of. This lack of restrictions allowed us to be creative and come up with new and innovative ideas. <br/><br/>The project's biggest strength was the freedom we had and the diverse expertise within our team. We had people from different educational backgrounds, which brought valuable perspectives. However, the challenge was to combine our expertise effectively. <br/><br/>Our mentors played a crucial role in shaping our concept by giving us helpful feedback throughout the project. Their input had a big impact on our final idea. <br/><br/>Personally, one of the most important things I learned from this experience was how to work effectively with people from different cultures and educational backgrounds. It was a chance for me to improve my collaboration skills and be open to different ways of thinking.",
